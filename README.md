## **Project Background:**
 This project will help us learn how to build React apps and make an api calls to obtain data and then utilize that data.

## **Project Goals:**
 * Write a program from scratch
 * Design and implement our app in React using states and props
 * Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

<!-- ~~W.I.P~~ -->

<!-- HORIZONTAL RULE TRIPLE HYPHENS --- USE TO SEPARATE CONTENT AREAS  -->
